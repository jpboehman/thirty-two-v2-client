            <p>
              Information about your computer hardware and software may be
              automatically collected by 32 Analytics. This information can
              include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times

            <strong>Use of Cookies</strong>
            <p>
              The 32 Analytics website may use "cookies" to help you personalize
              your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on
              your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
              programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
              assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
              domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes
              of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
              The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
              returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize 32
              Analytics pages, or register with 32 Analytics site or services, a
              cookie helps 32 Analytics to recall your specific information on
              subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
              personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
              addresses, and so on. When you return to the same 32 Analytics
              website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
              so you can easily use the 32 Analytics features that you
              customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
              Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
              usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
              prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
              fully experience the interactive features of the 32 Analytics
              services or websites you visit.
