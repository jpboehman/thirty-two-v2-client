              jurisdiction and venue of courts in Illinois in all disputes
              arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site
              is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to
              all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this
              section. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment,
              or agency relationship exists between you and 32 Analytics as a
              result of this agreement or use of the Site. 32 Analytics's
              performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and
              legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in
              derogation of 32 Analytics's right to comply with governmental,
              court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to
              your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by 32
              Analytics with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement

              invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a
              valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
              of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
              continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this
              agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and 32
              Analytics with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or
              contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
              oral or written, between the user and 32 Analytics with respect to
              the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice
              given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
              administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
              agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
              other business documents and records originally generated and
